# Config files for several applications

## Vim
You first need to install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim) and install the plugins referenced in the .vimrc

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
$ vim +PluginInstall +qall
```
Forgot how one of those commands worked? Try my [**Vim Cheatsheet**](https://gist.github.com/mariofink/372104568780e26fa8846541c8e56e66)

## Zsh
Using Agnoster theme to be used together with a Powerline font.
Using mark & jump scripts to navigate the file system easily (see: [Quickly navigate your filesystem from the command-line](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/08/16/quickly-navigate-your-filesystem-from-the-command-line.html))
